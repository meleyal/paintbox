# Paintbox

[paintbox.es](http:paintbox.es)

Paintbox is a simple app for saving, sharing and remixing your favorite colors.
Think of it as social-bookmarking, but for colors.


## Paintbox is open source

Paintbox is also a utopian experiment in building an open source web app. 

If you have an idea for a feature, add it to [the list](https://github.com/meleyal/paintbox/issues) (vote up if there's a feature you'd like to see next).

A list of upcoming/planned features is [here](https://github.com/meleyal/paintbox/issues/labels/planned).

Better yet, if you're interested in developing a feature, fork the project and send a pull request.


## Personal goals

I made Paintbox for 2 reasons:

1. I wanted a simple, minimal app for saving colors online.

2. It was an excuse to learn more about Rails. The basic code is adapted from [railstutorial.org](http://railstutorial.org)

Also, thanks to [muxtape](http://muxtape.com) for the inspiration.
