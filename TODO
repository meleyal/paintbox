TODO:


- convert swatches#index (home page) to use BB

template for swatch (+ link to user)

options

jq templates






- rewrite

no rails rendering
rails is only json api


root = swatches index



get swatches from /users/meleyal/swatches

api.paintbox.es/users/meleyal/swatches


or (with authed user)

get swatches from /user/swatches

api.paintbox.es/users/swatches



does it need to a separate api?
api = request with .json








- api design

  http basic vs OAuth
    
  All API access is over HTTPS, 
  and accessed from the api.paintbox.es domain. 
  All data is sent and received as JSON.
  
  paintbox.es/api/method
  api.paintbox.es/method

  public
    GET /swatches
    GET /users/:user/swatches
    GET /colors
    
  auth
    GET     /user/swatches
    POST    /user/swatches (single or array)
    DELETE  /user/swatches (single or array)
    


  get swatches for current user
